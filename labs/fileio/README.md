3. Inside the lab folder, create three files: main.py,  test_main.py, and data.in
  - Copy data.in contents into data.in file
4. Type the partial code stub provided in main.py and test_main.py files and fix all FIXMEs. (80 points)

```bash
  $ pytest --version
  $ pip install -U pytest
  $ pytest test_main.py
```

7. Test the whole program manually.
9. Create screenshots showing your local test results (pytest and manual test of main.py) and save them to the lab folder. (20 points)
